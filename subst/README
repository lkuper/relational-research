This directory contains benchmarks for various algorithms and representations
of substitutions in miniKanren.

To run all tests with all versions type 'make'. In walktests.scm the variable
'long-tests' controls whether a very short version of the tests run, versus the 
full version.

mk-scratch.scm has the minimal changes needed to embed the deferred extension 
skew binary version.

The code runs only in chez, though it would be relatively straightforward to
convert it to r6rs (I kept an r6rs version in sync for a while).
